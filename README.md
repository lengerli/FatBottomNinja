Rep for Web GL version of Fat Bottom Ninja game

Fat Bottom Ninja is a 2D multiplayer shooter game inspired by Liero. 

Key idea was to substitute the counterintuitive keyboard aiming of Liero with mouse aiming.

The characters are simple round blobs with head bands and jelly bottoms, as per the name Fat Bottom Ninjas.

What I gained while developing this project:

- Rope wrap feature was fun to built and helped me understand/implement 2d physics of unity engine
- Although jelly sprites was purely for aesthetics, it was fun to work/alter  someone elses code for my own needs (Jelly sprites asset that i purchased was larger than 3000 lines, the original asset is available in assetstore.)
- Helped me understand game networking better and get comfortable with PUN asset.
- Made me realise built stage for WebGL with Unity is a good opportunity to make coffee because it always takes more than you expect :)
